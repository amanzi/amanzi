Change Log for Amanzi XML Input Specification (Version 2.x.x)
=============================================================

.. contents:: **Table of Contents**

Overview
========

The Amanzi simulator will continue to expand the available features and enhance current functionality.  This progress will result in modifications and additions to the XML input specification.  Specific versions of the XML input specification will only work with the corresponding Amanzi release version.  The following is a description of the changes made to the XML input specification and the Amanzi release version(s) that accept the input version.


Version 2.3 (Amanzi Release - devel - 9089:0bab76c51dee)
========================================================

Changeset 9089

NERSC build on  May 24, 2016.

Edison build path /project/projectdirs/m1012/amanzi/install/edison/mpich-7.3.1-gnu-5.2.0/Release-TPLs-0.92.24/default-160524/

Unstr_Chemistry_Controls
------------------------

* Including additional chemistry numerical controls for Alquimia-PFloTran.  These values get writting out to the PFloTran input file if automatically generated.  The new controls include the following elements:
  
  * activity_coefficients: available values include 'timestep' or 'off'.  The default value is 'timestep'.  If this is not included the default value is assumed and written to the PFloTran input file.

  * max_relative_change_tolerance: no default is set.  If this is not present no default will be written to the PFloTran input file.

  * max_residual_tolerance: no default is set.  If this is not present no default will be written to the PFloTran input file.



Version 2.3 (Amanzi Release - devel - #### )
==================================================

Changeset ####

NERSC build on  April #, 2016.

Edison build path /project/projectdirs/m1012/amanzi/install/edison/mpich-7.3.1-gnu-5.2.0/Release-TPLs-0.92.24/default-1604##/

This commit includes major updates to geochemistry.  Therefore, the schema version has been updated to 2.3.

Process Kernels
------------------

* The capability to automatically generate the PFloTran engine input file has been added.  If state="on" and engine="pflotran", but input_filename is missing the PFloTran input file will be written based on information in the XML input file.  Note, that the attribute database="filename.dat" must still be included and provided by the user or Akuna.

Phases
------

* Additionl attributes have been added to the "primary" element.  If the primary is a non-reactive species/solute and Amanzi is auto-generating the PFlotran input file, the attributes forward_rate and backward_rate need to be included.  Dummy values of 0 may be used.  This information need to be included in the PFloTran input file.

Geochemistry
------------

* If Amanzi is auto-generating the PFloTran input file, any geochemistry constraints must be named and defined here.  See example.xml for the possible options.

Materials
---------

* Additional subelements have been added to include information need if Amanzi is auto-generating the PFloTran input file.  Below are the new subelements.  See example.xml for examples of the syntax.
  
  * The subelement "minerals" has been added for defining minerals in the current material.  For each mineral, include a subelement "mineral" with the attributes "name", "volume_fraction", and "surface_area".

  * The subelement "ion_exchange" has been added for defining ion exchange in the current material. The subelement "cations" has the attribute "cec" for specifying the cation exchange capacity.  A series of subelements listing the cations and associated selectivity coefficient. 

  * The subelement "surface_complexation" has been added for defining surface complexes in the current material.  For each site, the subelement site has the attributes "name" for the site name and "density" for the site density.  A subelement "complexes" is a comma seperated list of complexes for the current site.  Note, the site and complexe names must match the names in the chemistry database file minus leading characters, such as ">".  Leading characters will be added when Amanzi writes the PFloTran input file.



Version 2.2.1 (Amanzi Release - devel - 8925 )
==================================================

Changeset 8925

NERSC build on  March 2, 2016.

Edison build path /project/projectdirs/m1012/amanzi/install/edison/mpich-7.3.1-gnu-5.2.0/Release-TPLs-0.92.23/default-160302/

Global Definitions
------------------

* Modified pattern for exponential so that expressions such as "1." and ".1" (no trailing or leading 0) are valid.  This primarily effects importing into Akuna.  This update is also included in the definition of coordinates.

process_kernels->chemistry
--------------------------

* Listing of the engine specific input file and database file have been moved the chemistry element as input_filename and database, respectively.

* The attribute algorithm for the element transport has been moved to unstr_transport_controls.  This is more consistent with our other process kernel numerical control structure.

phases
------

* The section solutes has been removed.  All non-reactive solutes are now listed as primaries.

execution_controls
------------------

* Moved the restart attribute up a level to a subelement of execution_controls.  This enforces the restriction of only 1 restart file being specified and read.

unstr_transport_controls
------------------------

* The subelement algorithm has been moved here.

unstr_chemistry_controls
------------------------

* Moved chemistry control options from the geochemistry section (and engine specific subelements) to the numerical_controls section.  This is more consistent with our other numerical control structures.  Note, only some of the options specified in subelements are valid for a given engine.  See the example.xml for comments.

geochemistry
------------

* Only verbosity and constraints are now specified under this section.  Numerical control options have been moved to the unstr_chemistry_control section.  The engine specific input file and database file have been moved to the process_kernels sections.

* The constraint attribute initial_guess has been renamed value.  Note, that this is the initial value and may be modified by equilibration in the chemistry engine.

materials
---------

* Non-reactive solutes are now named as primaries.  Reference to solute in the input file is being changed to primary.

initial_conditions/boundary_conditions
--------------------------------------

* The initial_condition/boundary_condition subelement solute_component has been renamed geochemistry_component.

* The initial_condition/boundary_condition subelement geochemistry has been removed.

Version 2.1.1 (Amanzi Release - devel - 8326 )
==================================================

Changeset 8326

NERSC build on  Aug 18, 2015.

viz
---

* Modification to the write_regions element.  To make this field more useful for production the user can now specify a list of "field" subelements.  The name given to the field will appear in the list of available fields to visualize.  Each region listed for the given field will be assigned and colored by an integer id.


Version 2.1.1 (Amanzi Release - devel - 8245 )
==================================================

Changeset 8245

NERSC build on  Aug 6, 2015.

str_amr_controls
----------------

* Several options take a series if integer values.  These values were indicated using a sequence of subelements named "int".  This has been updated to be a space separated list of integers within in the specific element.  The specific options require a minimum number of entries (either equal to the number of amr levels or the number of amr levels -1 ).  Any additional values will be ignored.

==================================================

Changeset 8135

NERSC build on  July 14, 2015.  

Edison build path /project/projectdirs/m1012/amanzi/install/hopper/mpich-7.1.1-gnu-4.9.2/Release-TPLs-0.92.18/default-150714  

Hopper build path /project/projectdirs/m1012/amanzi/install/hopper/mpich-7.1.1-gnu-4.9.2/Release-TPLs-0.92.18/default-150714

Build
-----

* The new python script UpdateSpec_210-211.py is now installed along with the executable and schema file in $INSTALL/bin.  This was added for convenience of users to update their input files as the schema continues to evolve.

Tools
-----

* Added the python script UpdateSpec_210-211.py to the repository in tools/install.  This script reads in an existing 2.1.0 input file and writes out an updated version consistent with the latest 2.1.0 spec (which will be updated to 2.1.1 soon).

Output
------

* Added `"vis`" element option `"write_regions`" to documentation.  This has been available for awhile but was not included in the documentation.

Version 2.1.0 (Amanzi Release - devel - 8061/8064)
==================================================

Changeset 8061/8064

NERSC build on  June 18, 2015.  

Edison build path /project/projectdirs/m1012/amanzi/install/hopper/mpich-7.1.1-gnu-4.9.2/Release-TPLs-0.92.18/default-150618  

Hopper build path /project/projectdirs/m1012/amanzi/install/hopper/mpich-7.1.1-gnu-4.9.2/Release-TPLs-0.92.18/default-150618

Numerical Controls
------------------

* Changed `"bdf1_integration_method`" attributes to elements.  This was done for consistency and readability.

* Changed element name from `"unstr_pseudo_time_integrator`" to `"unstr_initialization`".

* Added the parameter `"clipping_pressure`" to the renamed `"unstr_initialization`" list.

* Removed the parameter `"initialize_with_darcy`" from the section `"unstr_initialization`".  This section's parameters are used to initialize the steady time step and `"initialize_with_darcy`" is already specified under the steady-state section.

* Added the option `"darcy_solver`" the parameter `"method`" in the `"unstr_initialization`" list.


Version 2.1.0 (Amanzi Release - devel - 8005)
=============================================

Changeset 8005

NERSC build on  June 2, 2015.  

Edison build path /project/projectdirs/m1012/amanzi/install/hopper/mpich-7.1.1-gnu-4.9.2/Release-TPLs-0.92.17/default-150602  

Hopper build path /project/projectdirs/m1012/amanzi/install/hopper/mpich-7.1.1-gnu-4.9.2/Release-TPLs-0.92.17/default-150602

Execution Controls
------------------

* Added translation of execution time periods to `"Time Period Controls`" in the 1.2.3 input spec.

Output
------

* Both the 2.1.0 input schema and 1.2.3 input spec are moving towards using plural macros for time and cycle specifications.  This will affect vis, observations, checkpoint, and walkabout elements.  To help users transition the input translator (2.1.0 to 1.2.3) will read singular `"time_macro`" and `"cycle_macro`" and translate these to `"Time Macros`" and `"Cycle Macros`" with a single macro specified.  Also, the input parser for the unstructured algorithm will continue to read both singular and plural forms.  Note, these are temporary measures to ease transition.  Please updating input files to use the plural forms.


Version 2.1.0 (Amanzi Release - devel - 7926)
=============================================

Changeset 7926

NERSC build on  May 12, 2015.  

Edison build path /project/projectdirs/m1012/amanzi/install/hopper/mpich-7.1.1-gnu-4.9.2/Release-TPLs-0.92.17/default-150512  

Hopper build path /project/projectdirs/m1012/amanzi/install/hopper/mpich-7.1.1-gnu-4.9.2/Release-TPLs-0.92.17/default-150512

Numerical Controls
------------------

* Added missing preconditioner options under `"unstr_steady-state_controls`".  This update also included fixing the translation of the `"preconditioner`" option under `"unstr_linear_solver`"  which was incorrectly being mapped to `"steady preconditioner`" instead of `"linear solver preconditioner`".

* Cleaned up preconditioner specification for all locations.  For each unstructured numerical control with a `"preconditioner`" subelement, the valid options are the strings `"trilinos_ml`", `"hypre_amg`", or `"block_ilu`".  Options for each preconditioner have been consolidated in the subelement `"numerical_controls`" -> `"unstructured_controls`" -> `"preconditioners`".  The element `"preconditioners`" has a subelement for each preconditioner.  Each preconditioner has subelements for its specific options.
