#  Run Amanzi in docker container
#
#  Customize as you like, this is a simple example and assumes you want to run
#  in your current / present working directory:
#
#  - v mount_point_on_host:mount_point_on_container
#  - w sets current working directory on the container
#  --rm deletes the container on exit
#
#  There's not effort here to parse arguments.  Just assumes you are providing an xml file.
