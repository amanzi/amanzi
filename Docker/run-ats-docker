#
#  Run ATS in docker container
#
#  Customize as you like, this is a simple example and assumes you want to run
#  in your current / present working directory:
#
#  --mount provides the mount type,source, and target, e.g.,
#          --mount type=bind,source=mount_point_on_host,target=mount_point_on_container
#  -w      sets current working directory on the container
#  -it     -i and -t together provide an interactive terminal (a tty) for the container
#  -p      map host_port:container_port, e.g., -p 8899:8899 
#  --rm    deletes the container on exit
#
#  There's not effort here to parse arguments.  Just assumes you are providing an xml file.
