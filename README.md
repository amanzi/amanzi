BACKGROUND
-----------------------------------------------

The objective of the Advanced Simulation Capability for Environmental
Management (ASCEM) is to develop a state-of-the-art scientific
approach and tool for understanding and predicting contaminant fate
and transport in natural and engineered systems.  The modular and open
source high performance computing tool will facilitate integrated
approaches to modeling and site characterization that enable robust
and standardized assessments of performance and risk for EM cleanup
and closure activities. In addition, the integrated toolset will
incorporate capabilities for predicting releases from various waste
forms, identifying exposure pathways, performing dose calculations,
conducting systematic uncertainty quantification.

Amanzi, the Multi-Process HPC Simulator is a critical component of
this approach and tool.  Amanzi will be a highly modular and
extensible computational engine for simulations of flow and reactive
transport. Currently, it is capable of simulating transient saturated
and variably saturated (Richards) flows, transport with
non-grid-aligned dispersion and a variety of reactions. In the future
it will include non-isothermal, multi-phase multi-component,
geo-mechanical, and surface water models. To achive this ambitious
goal we are building Amanzi as a grass-roots collaboration of an
emerging broader community of geoscienists, computational and computer
scientists, and applied mathematicians.  This broader community is
leveraging its extensive experience, existing capabilities, and
untapped advances from their areas of expertise to develop Amanzi.

like write permission on the repository you must send an e-mail to

I [insert name], am currently employed by [insert lab].  I have read
and accept the terms and conditions presented in the COPYRIGHT file of
the Amanzi repository.  In particular, I understand that

 1. as a developer contributing new code to the Amanzi repository I
    must have the right to do so, implicitly asserting copyright on
    behalf of their laboratory on that contribution;

 2. all new code that is contributed will be under the standard
    three-clause BSD license contained in the copyright file, and so
    by contributing code I assert that I have the right to chose this
    BSD license for my contribution;

 3. if an existing package is contributed by a developer, the
    original copyright must be maintained, and the license must
    be compatible with the three-clause BSD license.

If I change employers I will either terminate my write (push) permission
or submit a new e-mail confirmation with my updated information 
in advance of the transition to my new job.

Sincerely, [insert name]
