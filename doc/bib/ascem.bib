  Abstract                 = {Gauss-Seidel is often the smoother of choice within
 multigrid applications. In the context of
 unstructured meshes, however, maintaining good
 parallel efficiency is difficult with multiplicative
 iterative methods such as Gauss-Seidel. This leads us
 to consider alternative smoothers. We discuss the
 computational advantages of polynomial smoothers
 within parallel multigrid algorithms for positive
 definite symmetric systems. Two particular
 polynomials are considered: Chebyshev and a
 multilevel specific polynomial. The advantages of
 polynomial smoothing over traditional smoothers such
 as Gauss-Seidel are illustrated on several
 applications: Poisson's equation, thin-body
 elasticity, and eddy current approximations to
 Maxwell's equations. While parallelizing the
 Gauss-Seidel method typically involves a compromise
 between a scalable convergence rate and maintaining
 high flop rates, polynomial smoothers achieve
 parallel scalable multigrid convergence rates without
 sacrificing flop rates. We show that, although
 parallel computers are the main motivation,
 polynomial smoothers are often surprisingly
 competitive with Gauss-Seidel smoothers on serial
 machines.}

  Abstract                 = {One of the major achievements in engineering science has been the 
 development of computer algorithms for solving nonlinear differential 
 equations such as the Navier-Stokes equations. Limited computer 
 resources have motivated the development of efficient numerical methods 
 in computational fluid dynamics (CFP) utilizing structured meshes. The 
 use of structured meshes greatly simplifies the implementation of CFD 
 algorithms on conventional computers. Structured meshes also permit the 
 use of highly efficient solution techniques such as alternating 
 direction implicit (ADI) iteration schemes or multigrid. Following the 
 dramatic improvement in computing speed, emphasis has shifted towards 
 the design of algorithms capable of treating complex geometries. 
 Unstructured grids offer one promising technique for treating these 
 general geometries. Unstructured meshes have irregular connectivity and 
 usually contain triangles and/or quadrilaterals in two dimensions and 
 tetrahedra and/or hexahedra in three dimensions. The generation and use 
 of unstructured grids poses new challenges in computational fluid 
 dynamics. This is true for both grid generation as well as for the 
 design of algorithms for flow solution. The author presents recent 
 developments in the unstructured grid generation and flow solution technology},

  Abstract                 = {We compare the accuracy of three, mixed
 explicit-implicit schemes for simulating
 nonrelativistic, radiative hydrodynamic phenomena in
 the equilibrium diffusion limit. Only the
 "low-energy-density" regime is considered, where it is
 possible to ignore the effects of radiation pressure
 and energy density in comparison to the fluid pressure
 and energy density. The governing equations are then
 those of compressible Eulerian hydrodynamics with a
 nonlinear, radiative heat-transfer term appearing in
 the energy equation. All three finite-volume methods in
 this study utilize an explicit Godunov method with an
 approximate Riemann solver to integrate the Euler
 equations, but differ in their iterative treatment of
 the radiation diffusion term, which is handled in an
 "operator-split" fashion. In the first method,
 diffusive effects are computed with a linearized
 implicit technique that does not converge
 nonlinearities within a computational time step. In the
 other two methods, a Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov
 procedure is used to converge the nonlinearities, and
 improved accuracy (but not always greater efficiency)
 is achieved over the more traditional
 linearized-implicit approach. The two Newton-Krylov
 methods differ in their order of accuracy in time; one
 is strictly first-order accurate, while the other
 attempts to achieve second-order accuracy by making use
 of a predictor-corrector architecture. Several examples
 are considered to demonstrate the convergence
 properties of the three schemes, but attention is
 limited to spherically symmetric problems such as the
 one-dimensional point explosion.}

  Abstract                 = {Efficient numerical simulation of physical processes is
 constrained by our ability to solve the resulting
 linear systems, prompting substantial research into
 the development of multiscale iterative methods
 capable of solving these linear systems with an
 optimal amount of effort. Overcoming the limitations
 of geometric multigrid methods to simple geometries
 and differential equations, algebraic multigrid
 methods construct the multigrid hierarchy based only
 on the given matrix. While this allows for efficient
 black-box solution of the linear systems associated
 with discretizations of many elliptic differential
 equations, it also results in a lack of robustness
 due to unsatisfied assumptions made on the near null
 spaces of these matrices. This paper introduces an
 extension to algebraic multigrid methods that removes
 the need to make such assumptions by utilizing an
 adaptive process. Emphasis is on the principles that
 guide the adaptivity and their application to
 algebraic multigrid solution of certain symmetric
 positive-definite linear systems.}

  Abstract                 = {Substantial effort has been focused over the last two
 decades on developing multilevel iterative methods
 capable of solving the large linear systems
 encountered in engineering practice. These systems
 often arise from discretizing partial differential
 equations over unstructured meshes, and the
 particular parameters or geometry of the physical
 problem being discretized may be unavailable to the
 solver. Algebraic multigrid (AMG) and multilevel
 domain decomposition methods of algebraic type have
 been of particular interest in this context because
 of their promises of optimal performance without the
 need for explicit knowledge of the problem
 geometry. These methods construct a hierarchy of
 coarse problems based on the linear system itself and
 on certain assumptions about the smooth components of
 the error. For smoothed aggregation (SA) multigrid
 methods applied to discretizations of elliptic
 problems, these assumptions typically consist of
 knowledge of the near-kernel or near-nullspace of the
 weak form. This paper introduces an extension of the
 SA method in which good convergence properties are
 achieved in situations where explicit knowledge of
 the near-kernel components is unavailable. This
 extension is accomplished in an adaptive process that
 uses the method itself to determine near-kernel
 components and adjusts the coarsening processes
 accordingly},

 decades on developing multi-level iterative methods
 capable of solving the large linear systems
 encountered in engineering practice. These systems
 often arise from discretizing partial differential
 equations over unstructured meshes, and the
 particular parameters or geometry of the physical
 problem being discretized may be unavailable to the
 solver. Algebraic multigrid (AMG) and multilevel
 domain decomposition methods of algebraic type have
 been of particular interest in this context because
 of their promises of optimal performance without the
 need for explicit knowledge of the problem
 geometry. These methods construct a hierarchy of
 coarse problems based on the linear system itself and
 on certain assumptions about the smooth components of
 the error. For smoothed aggregation (SA) methods
 applied to discretizations of elliptic problems,
 these assumptions typically consist of knowledge of
 the near-nullspace of the weak form. This paper
 introduces an extension of the SA method in which
 good convergence properties are achieved in
 situations where explicit knowledge of the
 near-nullspace components is unavailable. This
 extension is accomplished by using the method itself
 to determine near-nullspace components and adjusting
 the coarsening processes accordingly.},

  Abstract                 = {The conceptual development and implementation of a
 scalable nonlinear solver for the time-dependent
 three-dimensional (3D) compressible resistive
 magnetohydrodynamics model (MHD) is discussed. The
 approach is based on Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov
 technology, preconditioned with multigrid methods for
 algorithmic scalability. The key to the approach is
 the reformulation of the hyperbolic MHD system into a
 parabolic one, which is amenable to multigrid
 techniques. Such reformulation (parabolization) aims
 to render the modified system block diagonally
 dominant (unlike the original MHD system, which is
 diagonally submissive for implicit time steps Delta t
 larger than the explicit Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy time
 step). The algorithm has been tested on a variety of
 2D and 3D configurations which demonstrate its
 excellent algorithmic scalability properties. In
 particular, it is shown that, serially, the CPU time
 for a given simulation scales linearly with the number
 of unknowns, and that large CPU gains (similar to 30)
 are attainable with respect to an explicit approach
 even for moderate grids (256 x 256). In parallel, the
 algorithm features excellent scalability properties up
 to thousands of processors (4096) and millions of
 unknowns (similar to 1.3x10(8)).}

 resurgence in popularity, due in part to the dramatic
 increase in the need to solve physical problems posed
 on very large, unstructured grids. While AMG has proved
 its usefulness on various problem types, it is not
 commonly understood how wide a range of applicability
 the method has. In this study, we demonstrate that
 range of applicability, while describing some of the
 recent advances in AMG technology. Moreover, in light
 of the imperatives of modern computer environments, we
 also examine AMG in terms of algorithmic
 scalability. Finally, we show some of the situations in
 which standard AMG does not work well and indicate the
 current directions taken by AMG researchers to
 alleviate these difficulties.}

 structured, for example, block structured grids,
 composite grids in structured adaptive mesh refinement
 applications, and over-set grids; and a finite element
 interface (FEI) for unstructured problems, as well as
 a conventional linear-algebraic interface (IJ). It is
 extremely important to provide an efficient, scalable

 the scalable solvers of the library, especially when
 using tens of thousands of processors. This article
 describes the data structures, parallel

 solve linear systems of equations Ax = b where A is
 a user supplied n�n sparse matrix, b is a user
 supplied vector of length n and x is a vector of
 length n to be computed. ML should be used on large
 sparse linear systems arising from partial
 differential equation (PDE) discretizations. While
 technically any linear system can be considered, ML
 should be used on linear systems that correspond to
 things that work well with multigrid methods
 (e.g. elliptic PDEs). ML can be used as a
 stand-alone package or to generate preconditioners
 for a traditional iterative solver package
 (e.g. Krylov methods). We have supplied support for
 working with 3 the Aztec 2.1 and AztecOO iterative
 packages [19]. However, other solvers can be used by
 supplying a few functions. This document describes
 one specific algebraic multigrid approach: smoothed
 aggregation. This approach is used within several
 specialized multigrid methods: one for the eddy
 current formulation for Maxwell�s equations, and a
 multilevel and domain decomposition method for
 symmetric and nonsymmetric systems of equations
 (like elliptic equations, or compressible and
 incompressible fluid dynamics problems). Other
 methods exist within ML but are not described in
 this document. Examples are given illustrating the

  Abstract                 = {Driven by the need to solve linear systems arising from
 problems posed on extremely large, unstructured grids,
 there has been a recent resurgence of interest in
 algebraic multigrid (AMG). AMG is attractive in that it
 holds out the possibility of multigrid-like performance
 on unstructured grids. The sheer size of many modem
 physics and simulation problems has led to the
 development of massively parallel computers, and has
 sparked much research into developing algorithms for
 them. Parallelizing AMG is a difficult task, however
 While much of the AMG method parallelizes readily, the
 process of coarse-grid selection, in particular, is
 fundamentally sequential in nature. We have previously
 introduced a parallel algorithm (1998) for the
 selection of coarse-grid points, based on modifications
 of certain parallel independent set algorithms and the
 application of heuristics designed to insure the
 quality of the coarse grids, and shown results from a
 prototype serial version of the algorithm. In this
 paper we describe an implementation of a parallel AMG
 code, using the algorithm of A.J. Cleary et al. (1998)
 as well as other approaches to parallelizing the
 coarse-grid selection. We consider three basic
 coarsening schemes and certain modifications to the
 basic schemes, designed to address specific performance
 issues. We present numerical results for a broad range
 of problem sizes and descriptions, and draw conclusions
 regarding the efficacy of the method. Finally, we
 indicate the current directions of the research.},

 fundamental issues of developing software for these
 problems: (i) providing a streamlined process and
 set of tools for development of new algorithmic
 implementations and (ii) promoting interoperability
 of independently developed software. ; Trilinos uses
 a two-level software structure designed around
 collections of packages. A Trilinos package is an
 integral unit usually developed by a small team of
 experts in a particular algorithms area such as
 algebraic preconditioners, nonlinear solvers,
 etc. Packages exist underneath the Trilinos top
 level, which provides a common look-and-feel,
 including configuration, documentation, licensing,
 and bug-tracking. ; Here we present the overall
 Trilinos design, describing our use of abstract
 interfaces and default concrete implementations. We
 discuss the services that Trilinos provides to a
 prospective package and how these services are used
 by various packages. We also illustrate how packages
 can be combined to rapidly develop new
 algorithms. Finally, we discuss how Trilinos
 facilitates high-quality software engineering
 practices that are increasingly required from
 simulation software.}

 large-scale, complex multi-physics engineering and
 scienti c problems. Trilinos addresses two
 fundamental issues of developing software for these
 problems: (i) Providing a streamlined process and
 set of tools for development of new algorithmic
 implementations and (ii) promoting interoperability
 of independently developed software. \par Trilinos
 uses a two-level software structure designed around
 collections of packages. A Trilinos package is an
 integral unit usually developed by a small team of
 experts in a particular algorithms area such as
 algebraic preconditioners, nonlinear solvers,
 etc. Packages exist underneath the Trilinos top
 level, which provides a common look-and-feel,
 including configuration, documentation, licensing,
 and bug-tracking. \par Here we present the overall
 Trilinos design, describing our use of abstract
 interfaces and default concrete implementations. We
 discuss the services that Trilinos provides to a
 prospective package and how these services are used
 by various packages. We also illustrate how packages
 can be combined to rapidly develop new
 algorithms. Finally, we discuss how Trilinos
 facilitates highquality software engineering
 practices that are increasingly required from
 simulation software.},

  Abstract                 = {The Trilinos Project is an effort to facilitate the
 design, development, integration and ongoing support
 of mathematical software libraries. A new software
 capability is introduced into Trilinos as a
 package. A Trilinos package is an integral unit
 usually developed by a small team of experts in a
 particular algorithms area such as algebraic
 preconditioners, nonlinear solvers, etc. The
 Trilinos Users Guide is a resource for new and
 existing Trilinos users. Topics covered include how
 to configure and build Trilinos, what is required to
 integrate an existing package into Trilinos and
 examples of how those requirements can be met, as
 well as what tools and services are available to
 Trilinos packages. Also discussed are some common
 practices that are followed by many Trilinos package
 developers. Finally, a snapshot of current Trilinos
 packages and their interoperability status is
 provided, along with a list of supported computer
 platforms.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present a class of solvers developed
 for the parallel solution of Richards' equation, a
 model used in variably saturated flow
 simulations. These solvers take advantage of the fast,
 robust convergence of globalized Newton methods as well
 as the parallel scalability of multigrid
 preconditioners. We compare two multigrid methods. The
 methods differ primarily in their handling of
 discontinuous and anisotropic permeability fields, with
 one method invoking a simple pointwise smoothing
 technique and the other a more expensive plane
 smoother. Computational results are presented to show
 the effectiveness of the entire nonlinear solution
 procedure, to demonstrate the effect of discontinuities
 and anisotropies, and to explore parallel
 efficiencies.}

  Abstract                 = {Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) methods are
 synergistic combinations of Newton-type methods for
 superlinearly convergent solution of nonlinear
 equations and Krylov subspace methods for solving the
 Newton correction equations. The link between the two
 methods is the Jacobian-vector product, which may be
 probed approximately without forming and storing the
 elements of the true Jacobian, through a variety of
 means. Various approximations to the Jacobian matrix
 may still be required for preconditioning the resulting
 Krylov iteration. As with Krylov methods for linear
 problems, successful application of the JFNK method to
 any given problem is dependent on adequate
 preconditioning. JFNK has potential for application
 throughout problems governed by nonlinear partial
 differential equations and integro-differential
 equations. In this survey paper, we place JFNK in
 context with other nonlinear solution algorithms for
 both boundary value problems (BVPs) and initial value
 problems (IVPs). We provide an over-view of the
 mechanics of JFNK and attempt to illustrate the wide
 variety of preconditioning options available. It is
 emphasized that JFNK can be wrapped (as an accelerator)
 around another nonlinear fixed point method
 (interpreted as a preconditioning process, potentially
 with significant code reuse). The aim of this paper is
 not to trace fully the evolution of JFNK, nor to
 provide proofs of accuracy or optimal convergence for
 all of the constituent methods, but rather to present
 the reader with a perspective on how JFNK may be
 applicable to applications of interest and to provide
 sources of further practical information.}

 nonlinearities within a time step and time step
 control, on the accuracy of nonequilibrium radiation
 diffusion calculations. Typically, this type of
 calculation is performed using operator-splitting where
 the nonlinearities are lagged one time step. This
 method of integrating the nonlinear system results in
 an "effective" time-step constraint to obtain
 accuracy. A time-step control that limits the change in
 dependent variables (usually energy) per time step is
 used. We investigate the possibility that converging
 the nonlinearities within a time step may allow
 significantly larger time-step sizes and improved
 accuracy as well. The previously described
 Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method (JQSRT 63 (1999) 15)
 is used to converge all nonlinearities within a time
 step. In addition, a new time-step control method,
 based on the hyperbolic model of a thermal wave
 (J. Comput. Phys. 152 (1999) 790), is employed. The
 benefits and cost of a second-order accurate time step
 are considered. It is demonstrated that for a chosen
 accuracy, significant increases in solution efficiency
 can be obtained by converging nonlinearities within a
 time step.}

  Abstract                 = {The algebraic multigrid (AMG) approach provides a purely
 algebraic means to tackle the efficient solution of
 systems of equations posed on large unstructured
 grids, in 2D and 3D. While sequential AMG has been
 used for increasingly large problems (with several
 million unknowns), its application to even larger
 applications requires a parallel version. Since, in
 contrast to geometric multigrid, the hierarchy of
 coarser levels and the related operators develop
 dynamically during the setup phase of AMG, a direct
 parallelization is very complicated. Moreover, a
 "naive" parallelization would, in general, require
 unpredictable and highly complex communication
 patterns which seriously limit the achievable
 scalability, in particular of the costly setup
 phase. In this paper, we consider a classical AMG
 variant which has turned out be highly robust and
 efficient in solving large systems of equations
 corresponding to elliptic PDEs, discretized by finite
 differences or finite volumes. Based on a
 straightforward partitioning of variables (using one
 of the available algebraic partitioning tools such as
 Metis), a parallelization approach is proposed which
 minimizes the communication without sacrificing
 convergence in complex situations. Results will be
 presented for industrial CFD and oil-reservoir
 simulation applications on distributed memory
 machines, including PC-clusters.},

  Abstract                 = {An important constraint on our ability to simulate
 physical processes numerically is our ability to
 solve the resulting linear systems. Multiscale
 methods, such as multigrid, provide optimal or
 near-optimal order solution techniques for a wide
 range of problems. Current multigrid methods (both
 geometric and algebraic) rely on the use of effective
 coarse-scale operators to achieve this efficiency.
 Classical geometric multigrid methods construct these
 operators based on the geometry of a given problem
 and are, thus, most effective when this geometry is
 known and simple. Algebraic multigrid methods are
 free from most geometric constraints, instead relying
 on assumptions about the character of the matrix that
 limit the applicability of such methods to a
 relatively small class of problems.
 In this thesis, we first study the applicability of
 multigrid methods to the problem of flow through
 porous media, particularly motivated by the size of
 the linear systems resulting from discretization.
 For such problems, it is well known how to construct
 effective coarse-scale models for a correction-based
 multigrid method. For these robust multigrid
 solvers, we consider whether sufficient information
 is contained in the multigrid hierarchy to allow for
 efficient approximation of solutions of these linear
 systems. In particular, we examine important
 properties of the coarse-scale operators and the
 solutions to these coarse-scale equations and
 demonstrate their relevance to both the fine-scale
 and continuum-scale models.
 Additionally, we consider the question of
 improvements to multigrid algorithms in the form of
 adaptivity or self-correction. By utilizing the
 multigrid method itself to expose slow-to-converge
 components, we may adapt the multigrid hierarchy in
 order to improve performance, resulting in enhanced
 efficiency for a new class of problems. We present
 results for both the classical algebraic multigrid
 and smoothed aggregation frameworks illustrating
 typical multigrid efficiency with fewer assumptions
 on the given matrix systems. We consider theoretical
 issues of this adaptive procedure in the
 reduction-based algebraic multigrid setting. }

 condition number bounds for conforming linear
 elements in two and three dimensions. The bounds are
 independent of arbitrary coefficient jumps between
 subdomains and of the number of subdomains, and grow
 only as the squared logarithm of the mesh size h.

  Abstract                 = {We propose a fast iterative method to optimize coarse
 basis functions in algebraic multigrid by minimizing
 the sum of their energies, subject to the condition
 that linear combinations of the basis functions equal
 to given zero energy modes, and subject to
 restrictions on the supports of the coarse basis
 functions. For a particular selection of the
 supports, the first iteration gives exactly the same
 basis functions as our earlier method using smoothed
 aggregation. The convergence rate of the minimization
 algorithm is bounded independently of the mesh size
 under usual assumptions on finite elements. The
 construction is presented for scalar problems as well
 as for linear elasticity. Computational results on
 difficult industrial problems demonstrate that the
 use of energy minimal basis functions improves
 algebraic multigrid performance and yields a more
 robust multigrid algorithm than smoothed
 aggregation.},

  Abstract                 = {The relative performance of a nonlinear full
 approximation storage multigrid algorithm and an
 equivalent linear multigrid algorithm for solving two
 different nonlinear problems is investigated. The
 first case consists of a transient radiation
 diffusion problem for which an exact linearization is
 available, while the second problem involves the
 solution of the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations,
 where a first-order discrete Jacobian is employed as
 an approximation to the Jacobian of a
 second-order-accurate discretization. When an exact
 linearization is employed, the linear and nonlinear
 multigrid methods asymptotically converge at
 identical rates and the linear method is found to be
 more efficient due to its lower cost per cycle. When
 an approximate linearization is employed, as in the
 Navier-Stokes cases, the relative efficiency of the
 linear approach versus the nonlinear approach depends
 both on the degree to which the linear system
 approximates the full Jacobian as well as on the
 relative cost of linear versus nonlinear multigrid
 cycles. For cases where convergence is limited by a
 poor Jacobian approximation, substantial speedup can
 be obtained using either multigrid method as a
 preconditioner to a Newton-Krylov method.}

  Abstract                 = {The efficiency of three multigrid methods for solving
 highly non-linear diffusion problems on
 two-dimensional unstructured meshes is examined. The
 three multigrid methods differ mainly in the manner
 in which the non-linearities of the governing
 equations are handled. These comprise a non-linear
 full approximation storage (FAS) multi-rid method
 which is used to solve the non-linear equations
 directly, a linear multigrid method which is used to
 solve the linear system arising from a Newton
 linearization of the non-linear system, and a hybrid
 scheme which is based on a non-linear FAS multigrid
 scheme, but employs a linear solver on each level as
 a smoother. Results indicate that, ill the
 asymptotic convergence region, all methods are
 equally effective at converging the lion-linear
 residual in a given number of multigrid cycles, but
 that the linear solver is more efficient in cpu time
 due to the lower cost of linear versus non-linear
 grid sweeps.},

  Abstract                 = {An implicit and nonlinearly consistent (INC) solution
 technique is presented for the two-dimensional
 shallow-water equations. Since the method is implicit,
 and therefore unconditionally stable, time steps may be
 used that result in both gravity wave
 Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) numbers and advection CFL
 numbers being larger than one. By nonlinearly
 consistent it is meant that all of the unknown
 variables appear at the same time level in the
 equations and are solved for simultaneously in an
 iterative manner (i.e. no splitting errors in
 time). The INC method is compared to a more traditional
 semi-implicit method for stepping over the gravity wave
 stability constraint. Results are presented that show
 that the second-order-in-time INC method can maintain a
 high level of accuracy if the dynamical timescale of
 the system is resolved by the time step. To investigate
 this difference in temporal integration accuracy
 between the nonlinearly consistent method and the
 semi-implicit method an approximate modified equation
 analysis was performed. The INC solution technique
 employed is the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK)
 method. Preconditioning of the JFNK method is achieved
 via a semi-implicit solution method. The height matrix
 from the semi-implicit algorithm is solved using a
 multigrid linear solver to provide efficiency and
 scalability.}

  Abstract                 = {An algorithm is presented for the solution of the time
 dependent reaction-diffusion systems which arise in
 nonequilibrium radiation diffusion applications. This
 system of nonlinear equations is solved by coupling
 three numerical methods, Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov,
 operator splitting, and multigrid linear solvers. An
 inexact Newton's method is used to solve the system of
 nonlinear equations. Since building the Jacobian matrix
 for problems of interest can be challenging, we employ
 a Jacobian-free implementation of Newton's method,
 where the action of the Jacobian matrix on a vector is
 approximated by a first order Taylor series
 expansion. Preconditioned generalized minimal residual
 (PGMRES) is the Krylov method used to solve the linear
 systems that come from the iterations of Newton's
 method. The preconditioner in this solution method is
 constructed using a physics-based divide and conquer
 approach, often referred to as operator splitting. This
 solution procedure inverts the scalar elliptic systems
 that make up the preconditioner using simple multigrid
 methods. The preconditioner also addresses the strong
 coupling between equations with local 2*2 block
 solves. The intra-cell coupling is applied after the
 inter-cell coupling has already been addressed by the
 elliptic solves. Results are presented using this
 solution procedure that demonstrate its efficiency
 while incurring minimal memory requirements.}

  Abstract                 = {A numerical framework for simulating hurricanes based
 upon solving a nonlinear equation set with an
 implicitly balanced solution procedure is described in
 this paper. The physical model is the Navier-Stokes
 equations plus a highly simplified and differentiable
 microphysics parameterization package. Because the
 method is fully implicit, the approach is able to
 employ time steps that result in
 Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) numbers greater than one
 for advection, gravity, and sound waves; however, the
 dynamical time scale of the problem must still be
 respected for accuracy. The physical model is solved
 via the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) method. The
 JFNK approach typically requires the approximate
 solution of a large linear system several times per
 time step. To increase the efficiency of the linear
 system solves, a physics-based preconditioner has been
 employed. To quantify the accuracy and efficiency of
 the new approach against traditional approaches, the
 implicitly balanced solver was first compared against
 semi-implicit approaches for the simulation of a
 precipitating moist bubble. The moist-bubble
 simulations demonstrated the ability of the implicitly
 balanced approach to achieve a given level of accuracy
 in a more efficient manner than either a first-order
 semi-implicit approach or a traditional leapfrog
 semi-implicit approach. This behavior is further
 illustrated in first-of-a-kind three-dimensional
 implicitly balanced hurricane simulations that reveal
 the first-order-in-time semi-implicit algorithm needs
 to take a time step at least 60 times smaller than the
 implicitly balanced algorithm to produce a comparable
 accuracy.}

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this note is to describe a time step
 control technique as applied to radiation
 diffusion. Standard practice only provides a heuristic
 criteria related to the relative change in the
 dependent variables. We propose an alternative based on
 relatively simple physical principles. This time step
 control applies to methods of solution that are
 unconditionally stable and converges nonlinearities
 within a time step in the governing
 equations. Commonly, nonlinearities in the governing
 equations are evaluated using existing (old time) data,
 We refer to this as the semi-implicit method. When a
 method converges nonlinearities within a time step, the
 entire governing equation including all nonlinearities
 is self-consistently evaluated using advance time data
 (with appropriate time centring for accuracy). This
 criteria grew out of our work using Newton-Krylov
 methods to solve radiation diffusion problems. We
 observed that standard time step control ideas were
 poorly correlated to our results with regards to
 efficiency and accuracy. Our results indicated that
 using a method that converged nonlinearities allows
 much larger time step sizes with acceptable accuracy.}

 of nonlinearity found in the fourth-order dependence of
 the radiation energy on temperature, the temperature
 dependence of the opacity, and flux limiting. The
 efficiency of both the linear and nonlinear iterative
 techniques is investigated. With the realistic time
 step control the solution of the linear system does not
 scale linearly with multigrid as might be expected from
 theory. In contrast, we find that the use of multigrid
 to precondition a Newton-Krylov (GMRES) method provides
 a robust, scalable solution for the nonlinear
 system. Also only through converging the nonlinearities
 within a time step does the solution method achieve its
 design accuracy.}

  Abstract                 = {ML is a multigrid preconditioning package intended to
 solve linear systems of equations Ax = b where A is
 a user supplied n�n sparse matrix, b is a user
 supplied vector of length n and x is a vector of
 length n to be computed. ML should be used on large
 sparse linear systems arising from partial
 differential equation (PDE) discretizations. While
 technically any linear system can be considered, ML
 should be used on linear systems that correspond to
 things that work well with multigrid methods
 (e.g. elliptic PDEs). ML can be used as a
 stand-alone package or to generate preconditioners
 for a traditional iterative solver package
 (e.g. Krylov methods). We have supplied support for
 working with the Aztec 2.1 and AztecOO iterative
 packages [21]. However, other solvers can be used by
 supplying a few functions. This document describes
 one specific algebraic multigrid approach: smoothed
 aggregation. This approach is used within several
 specialized multigrid methods: one for the eddy
 current formulation for Maxwell\u2019s equations,
 and a multilevel and domain decomposition method for
 symmetric and nonsymmetric systems of equations
 (like elliptic equations, or compressible and
 incompressible fluid dynamics problems). Other
 methods exist within ML but are not described in
 this document. Examples are given illustrating the
 problem definition and exercising multigrid options.},

 increasing demand for more efficient methods to solve
 large sparse, unstructured linear systems of
 equations. For practically relevant problem sizes,
 classical one-level methods had already reached their
 limits and new hierarchical algorithms had to be
 developed in order to allow an efficient solution of
 even larger problems. This paper gives a review of the
 first hierarchical and purely matrix-based approach,
 algebraic multigrid (AMG). AMG can directly be applied,
 for instance, to efficiently solve various types of
 elliptic partial differential equations discretized on
 unstructured meshes, both in 2D and 3D. Since AMG does
 not make use of any geometric information, it is a
 "plug-in" solver which can even be applied to problems
 without any geometric background, provided that the
 underlying matrix has certain properties.},

  Abstract                 = {Since the early nineties there has been a strongly
 increasing demand for more efficient methods to solve
 large sparse and unstructured linear systems of
 equations. For practically relevant problem sizes
 classical one-level methods had already
 reached their limits and new hierarchical algorithms
 had to be developed in order to allow an efficient
 solution of even larger problems. The purpose of this
 paper is to give an elementary introduction to the
 first hierarchical and purely matrix-based
 approach, algebraic multigrid (AMG). The main idea behind
 AMG is to extend the classical ideas of geometric
 multigrid (smoothing and coarse-grid correction) to
 certain classes of algebraic systems of equations.
 Besides its robustness and efficiency, the main practical
 advantage of AMG is that it can directly be applied,
 for instance, to solve various types of elliptic
 partial dierential equations discretized on
 unstructured meshes, both in 2D and 3D. Since AMG does
 not make use of any geometric information it is a
 "plug-in" solver which can even be applied to problems
 without any geometric background, provided that the
 underlying matrix satisfies certain properties. Although
 the development of AMG goes back to the early
 eighties, it still provides one of the most efficient
 algebraic methods to solve corresponding problems.

 modications and extensions have been introduced. In

  Abstract                 = {Accurate model predictions of water flow and solute
 transport in unsaturated soils require a correct
 representation of relevant mechanisms in a
 mathematical model, as well as correct solutions of
 the mathematical equations. Because of the
 complexity of boundary conditions and the
 nonlinearity of the processes considered, general
 solutions of the mathematical equations rely on
 numerical approximations. We evaluate a number of
 numerical models (WAVE, HYDRUS_1D, SWAP, MARTHE, and
 MACRO) that use different numerical methods to solve
 the flow and transport equations. Our purpose is to
 give an overview of analytical solutions that can be
 found for simple initial and boundary conditions and
 to define benchmark scenarios to check the accuracy
 of numerical solutions. Included are analytical
 solutions for coupled transport equations that
 describe flow and transport in dual-velocity
 media. The relevance of deviations observed in the
 analytical benchmarks for more realistic boundary
 conditions is illustrated an intercode comparison
 for natural boundary conditions. For the water flow
 scenarios, the largest deviations between numerical
 models and analytical solutions were observed for
 the case of soil limited evaporation. The intercode
 differences could be attributed to the
 implementation of the evaporation boundary
 condition: the spatial discretization and the
 internode averaging of the hydraulic conductivity in
 the surface grid layer. For solute transport,
 accurate modeling of solute dispersion poses the
 most problems. Nonlinear and nonequilibrium sorption
 and coupled transport in pore domains with different
 advection velocities are in general accurately
 simulated.}

 described in the case of a general elliptic

 a polynomial of the number of levels, and requires
 only a uniform weak approximation property for the
 aggregation operators. This property can be a-priori
 verified computationally once the aggregates are
 known. For illustration, it is also verified here
 for a uniformly elliptic diffusion equations
 discretized by linear conforming quasiuniform finite
 elements. Only very weak and natural assumptions on
 the hierarchy of aggregates are needed.},
