                three-dimensional (3D) compressible resistive
                magnetohydrodynamics model (MHD) is discussed. The
                approach is based on Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov
                technology, preconditioned with multigrid methods for
                algorithmic scalability. The key to the approach is
                the reformulation of the hyperbolic MHD system into a
                parabolic one, which is amenable to multigrid
                techniques. Such reformulation (parabolization) aims
                to render the modified system block diagonally
                dominant (unlike the original MHD system, which is
                diagonally submissive for implicit timesteps Delta t
                larger than the explicit Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy time
                step). The algorithm has been tested on a variety of
                2D and 3D configurations which demonstrate its
                excellent algorithmic scalability properties. In
                particular, it is shown that, serially, the CPU time
                for a given simulation scales linearly with the number
                of unknowns, and that large CPU gains (similar to 30)
                are attainable with respect to an explicit approach
                even for moderate grids (256 x 256). In parallel, the
                algorithm features excellent scalability properties up
                to thousands of processors (4096) and millions of
                unknowns (similar to 1.3x10(8)).}

               upon solving a nonlinear equation set with an
               implicitly balanced solution procedure is described in
               this paper. The physical model is the Navier-Stokes
               equations plus a highly simplified and differentiable
               microphysics parameterization package. Because the
               method is fully implicit, the approach is able to
               employ timesteps that result in
               Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) numbers greater than one
               for advection, gravity, and sound waves; however, the
               dynamical time scale of the problem must still be
               respected for accuracy. The physical model is solved
               via the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) method. The
               JFNK approach typically requires the approximate
               solution of a large linear system several times per
               timestep. To increase the efficiency of the linear
               system solves, a physics-based preconditioner has been
               employed. To quantify the accuracy and efficiency of
               the new approach against traditional approaches, the
               implicitly balanced solver was first compared against
               semi-implicit approaches for the simulation of a
               precipitating moist bubble. The moist-bubble
               simulations demonstrated the ability of the implicitly
               balanced approach to achieve a given level of accuracy
               in a more efficient manner than either a first-order
               semi-implicit approach or a traditional leapfrog
               semi-implicit approach. This behavior is further
               illustrated in first-of-a-kind three-dimensional
               implicitly balanced hurricane simulations that reveal
               the first-order-in-time semi-implicit algorithm needs
               to take a timestep at least 60 times smaller than the
               implicitly balanced algorithm to produce a comparable
               accuracy.}

               equations and Krylov subspace methods for solving the
               Newton correction equations. The link between the two
               methods is the Jacobian-vector product, which may be
               probed approximately without forming and storing the
               elements of the true Jacobian, through a variety of
               means. Various approximations to the Jacobian matrix
               may still be required for preconditioning the resulting
               Krylov iteration. As with Krylov methods for linear
               problems, successful application of the JFNK method to
               any given problem is dependent on adequate
               preconditioning. JFNK has potential for application

               variety of preconditioning options available. It is
               emphasized that JFNK can be wrapped (as an accelerator)
               around another nonlinear fixed point method
               (interpreted as a preconditioning process, potentially
               with significant code reuse). The aim of this paper is
               not to trace fully the evolution of JFNK, nor to
               provide proofs of accuracy or optimal convergence for
               all of the constituent methods, but rather to present
               the reader with a perspective on how JFNK may be
               applicable to applications of interest and to provide
               sources of further practical information.}

               nonlinear, radiative heat-transfer term appearing in
               the energy equation. All three finite-volume methods in
               this study utilize an explicit Godunov method with an
               approximate Riemann solver to integrate the Euler

               method preconditioned by a multigrid method. The
               multigrid iteration matrix results from a Picard-type
               linearization of the governing equations, The governing
               equation is highly nonlinear with the principal forms
               of nonlinearity found in the fourth-order dependence of
               the radiation energy on temperature, the temperature
               dependence of the opacity, and flux limiting. The
               efficiency of both the linear and nonlinear iterative
               techniques is investigated. With the realistic time
               step control the solution of the linear system does not
               scale linearly with multigrid as might be expected from
               theory. In contrast, we find that the use of multigrid
               to precondition a Newton-Krylov (GMRES) method provides
               a robust, scalable solution for the nonlinear
               system. Also only through converging the nonlinearities
               within a timestep does the solution method achieve its
               design accuracy.}

                 approximation storage multigrid algorithm and an
                 equivalent linear multigrid algorithm for solving two
                 different nonlinear problems is investigated. The
                 first case consists of a transient radiation
                 diffusion problem for which an exact linearization is
                 available, while the second problem involves the
                 solution of the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations,
                 where a first-order discrete Jacobian is employed as
                 an approximation to the Jacobian of a
                 second-order-accurate discretization. When an exact
                 linearization is employed, the linear and nonlinear
                 multigrid methods asymptotically converge at
                 identical rates and the linear method is found to be
                 more efficient due to its lower cost per cycle. When
                 an approximate linearization is employed, as in the
                 Navier-Stokes cases, the relative efficiency of the
                 linear approach versus the nonlinear approach depends
                 both on the degree to which the linear system
                 approximates the full Jacobian as well as on the
                 relative cost of linear versus nonlinear multigrid
                 cycles. For cases where convergence is limited by a
                 poor Jacobian approximation, substantial speedup can
                 be obtained using either multigrid method as a
                 preconditioner to a Newton-Krylov method.}

                 which is used to solve the non-linear equations
                 directly, a linear multigrid method which is used to
                 solve the linear system arising from a Newton
                 linearization of the non-linear system, and a hybrid
                 scheme which is based on a non-linear FAS multigrid
                 scheme, but employs a linear solver on each level as
                 a smoother.  Results indicate that, ill the
