note:
   amax, iang: the max. angular degree (amax) of the arc and the no. of
	 intervals (iang) along that arc at which drawdown is to be
	 calculated.  iang and amax are used for preparation of contour
	 maps. if drawdown at only one obs. well at a specific radial
	 distance is needed, then input iang = 0 and amax = 0.0.  note
	 that iang cannot exceed 50 - if larger no. is desired, change
	 the dimensions of the drdn array.
   rpump & angpump: radial and angular location of pumping well. remember
	 that radial and angular position of observation well(s) is read in
	 from obs.dat file.
   q: pumpage
   tau, tauinc, ntau: initial time, time increment and # of time steps.
		      tau(i) = tau(i-1) + tau*(tauinc**(i-1))
	  where tau(i) is the ith time step.
   given: overall convergence criterion for summation and integration series
   ibgn: max. # of terms to be used in the summation series. if unsure about 
	 this number, input a large number (300 to 1000).  cannot exceed the
	 nsum value given in the parameter statement in the parametr.pod 
	 program.
   bbsl and bbsmin: max. and min. nos. that can be manipulated by your computer.
   tlimit: convergence criterion for numerical integration over one subinterval.
	 should be equal to or smaller than given.
   start1 & enging1: starting and ending values of the first integration 
	 subinterval. start1 must be > 0. typical value: start1=1e-10 to 1e-04
	 and ending1=1e-04 to 1e00.  reduce ending1 to speed up calculations.
   aplus: increment for the second integration subinterval. aplus is usually one 
	  to five times larger than ending1.
