note:
   if iprint .eq. 0, then no intemediate results will be printed out
during integration
   if the rel. error (tlimit1) is much greater than 1.e-10, errors approaching 
the significant level may appear.
	npump is the zone in which the pumping well is located.  tau is
the initial time step, tauinc is the time step acceleration factor, and
ntau is the number of time steps.
	the number of terms to be used for the stehfest algorithm (n) should
be between 10 and 20 for double precision calculations. the smaller the
n value, the faster the calculation.  a smaller value of n will result
in a larger error in the solution. setting n to the largest # of digits the
computer can keep (usually 16 for double precision) will yield the most
accurate solution
	the max. allowed relative error (tlimit1) for the integration
approximation must be less than the inverse of the maximum
value of the coefficient vector used in the stehfest algorithm (v(j,n)).
