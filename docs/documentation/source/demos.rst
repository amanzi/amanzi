ATS Demo Problems
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The best way to learn how to use ATS is by looking at our suite of
demonstration problems.  This is a suite of problems that look to
provide many simple, and some complex, examples of how to link
together the various physics capabilities in ATS.

In all, for every process in ATS, we try to provide at least one
example, and preferably two -- one that is simple and shows how the
process works, and one that is complex and shows how it links to other
processes in a real problem.  In addition to input files for these
examples, we strive to include a Jupyter notebook which explains all
needed inputs and outputs of that example, and shows some plots that
demonstrate how the process works.  This is somewhat aspirational at
the moment -- our demos do not cover the entire suite of processes --
but new demos are always welcome contributions.

The problems are organized by type of capability, and include
multiple examples.  For instance, the ecohydrology notebook includes
examples of evaporation and transpiration through a broad range of
complexity of approaches, from prescribed values to Priestly-Taylor
evaporation to fully biogeophysical models.

Note that ats-demos is its own repo.  This repo can be checked out
(either standalone or as a submodule of ATS), and the demos can be
run, modified, etc.  Installation notes for the demos are included in
that repository in its `README
<https://github.com/amanzi/ats-demos.git>`_.
