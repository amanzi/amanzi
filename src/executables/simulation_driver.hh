ATS's top-level main accepts an XML list including a few required elements.

* `"mesh`" ``[mesh-typed-spec-list]`` A list of Mesh_ spec objects, with
  domain names given by the name of the sublist.

* `"regions`" ``[region-spec-list]`` A list of geometric Region_
  specs, with names given by the name of the sublist.

* `"cycle driver`" ``[coordinator-spec]``  See the Coordinator_ spec.

* `"visualization`" ``[visualization-spec-list]`` A list of
  Visualization_ specs, one for each mesh/domain, controlling
  simulation output that is sparse in time but across the entirety
  of the domain.

* `"observations`" ``[observation-spec-list]`` An list of Observation_
  specs, output that is sparse/local in space but across the entirety
  of time.

* `"checkpoint`" ``[checkpoint-spec]`` A Checkpoint_ spec, controlling
  output intended for restart.

* `"PKs`" ``[list]``  List of all PKs to be used in the simulation.

* `"state`" ``[state-spec]`` A State_ spec controlling evaluators and
  other data.
