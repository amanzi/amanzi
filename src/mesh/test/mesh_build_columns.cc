/*
  build_columns() insantiates extra data structures in a Mesh that provide
  semi-structured functionality, specifically around meshes whose vertical
  structure consists of stacks of cells, or columns.  Fully unstructured in x
  and y, nodes and cells are vertically structured.

  Note that pinchouts and variances in dz cause cell centroids to not be
  vertically stacked!  But nodes will always be vertically stacked.  In fact,
  this can be extreme enough that a cell's centroid may have a larger z
  coordinate than the face above its centroid.

  This test works with an extruded mesh, where the dz is uniform across the
  layer of cells, in which case cell centroids are also vertically stacked.
