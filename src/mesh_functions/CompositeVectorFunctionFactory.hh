//! Mesh Functions, evaluate a function on a mesh and stick the result in a vector.

/*!

CompositeVectorFunctions are ways of evaluating a piecewise function on a
mesh and sticking the result into a CompositeVector.

This is used in a variety of ways -- Initial Conditions, Boundary
Conditions, and Independent Variable Evaluators.

Typically any containing object of this spec is a list of these specs.  The
list is indexed by Region, and the regions (logically) should partition the
domain (or boundary of the domain in the case of BCs).

Each entry in that list is a:

``[composite-vector-function-spec]``

ONE OF:
* `"region`" ``[string]`` Region on which this function is evaluated.
OR:
* `"regions`" ``[Array(string)]`` List of regions on which this function is evaluated.
END

ONE OF:
* `"component`" ``[string]`` Mesh component to evaluate this on.  This is one of "cell", "face", "node", "edge",
  or "boundary_face". The last two may require additional conditions, such as a proper mesh initialization.
  The mask "*" could be used in place of the component name.
OR:
* `"components`" ``[Array(string)]`` Mesh components to evaluate this on.  This is some collection of "cell", "face", 
  "node", "edge", and/or "boundary_face". The last two may require additional conditions, such as a proper mesh 
  initialization.  The array with the single entry "*" could be used to initialize all existing components.
END

* `"function`" ``[function-typedsublistdash-spec]`` The spec to provide the actual algebraic function.
