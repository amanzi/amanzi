  The helper advection-based base class for various remap methods. It
  provides support of time integration and calculation of various static
  and dynamic geometric quantities. The actual time-step loop could be
  implemented differently by an application.

  The integration is performed on the pseudo-time interval from 0 to 1. 
  The remap velocity u is constant, but since the integration is performed
  in the reference coordinate system associated with mesh0, the transformed
  velocity v is the time-dependent quantity. We call it as co-velocity,
  v = C^t u where C is the matrix of co-factors for the Jacobian matrix J.
  Recall that C = det(J) J^{-T}. The co-velocity is reprsented using a
  space-time polynomial.

  Input parameter list describes operators, limiters, and mesh maps,
  see native spec for more detail. 

  The design breaks implemetation into generic core capabilities (a helper
  class) and templated time integrator.
