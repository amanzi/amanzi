/*!

Relations like the Kozenyâ€“Carman equation are used to estimate changes in permeability
due to changes in porosity, e.g. due to mineral precipitation or biofilm accumulation.
The change in permeability is calculated by relating the current permeability, :math:`K`,
based on the current porosity, :math:`\phi`, to the initial or reference permeability
and porosity:

.. math::
  K = K_0 \frac{f(\phi)}{f(\phi_0)}
