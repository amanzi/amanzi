//! Basic land cover/plant function type

/*!

This is a simple base class for PFTs, but currently called LandCover_t to
differentiate from PFT, which is currently used by the dynamic BGC PK.

This class gets used for compositional land cover, such as NLCD data.  To use
this, a list of these specs is included in the "initial conditions" list of
State, and can be used by multiple evaluators somehow.  These are much cleaner
to work with in "new state."

The names of each spec in the list correspond to the region on the surface mesh
of that land cover type.  These regions should partition the surface domain,
although this is not checked, and exact behavior depends upon the evaluators
using these.  In practice, the regions are processed in the order they appear
in the list, and if a cell is in multiple regions, the last region's value will
take precedence.

In general, all parameter values are initialized as signalling NaNs, so if they
are used but not set, the code with throw.  This allows users to _not_ include
values if they aren't using models that need those values.

The parameters are used in a few different models.  In general, the use of this
class allows multiple evaluators to share these parameters.  The advantage of
this approach is that there is no fear of inconsistent parameters across
models.  The downside of this approach is that these parameters must have the
same region-based partitioning.

.. _land-cover-spec:
.. admonition:: land-cover-spec

    * `"rooting depth max [m]`" ``[double]`` Below this the rooting fraction is
      set to 0. [m]
    * `"rooting profile alpha [-]`" ``[double]`` alpha in the rooting profile
      function [-]
    * `"rooting profile beta [-]`" ``[double]`` beta in the rooting profile
      function [-] Note that these are from the CLM 4.5 Technical Note.

    * `"mafic potential at fully closed stomata [Pa]`" ``[double]``
    * `"mafic potential at fully open stomata [Pa]`" ``[double]`` Transpiration
      is typically multipled by a limiter that is empirically modeling stomata
      closure.  Typically it varies linearly from 0 to 1 as a function of
      mafic potential (soil pore capillary pressure), between these two
      values. [Pa]

    * `"leaf on time [doy]`" ``[double]`` Day of year, relative to time 0, when leaves
       begin transpiring.  Note that -1 implies evergreen. [doy]
    * `"leaf off time [doy]`" ``[double]`` Day of year, relative to time 0, when leaves
       stop transpiring.  Note that -1 implies evergreen. [doy]

    * `"Priestley-Taylor alpha of snow [-]`" ``[double]`` Evaporation coefficient
      in the Priestley-Taylor model, used in sublimation of snow.
    * `"Priestley-Taylor alpha of bare ground [-]`" ``[double]`` Evaporation coefficient
      in the Priestley-Taylor model, used in bare soil
    * `"Priestley-Taylor alpha of canopy [-]`" ``[double]`` Evaporation coefficient
      in the Priestley-Taylor model, used in sublimation of snow.
    * `"Priestley-Taylor alpha of transpiration [-]`" ``[double]`` Evaporation coefficient
      in the Priestley-Taylor model, used in transpiration.

    * `"interception coefficient [-]`" ``[double]`` Fraction, per unit LAI, of
       water intercepted by the canopy.

    * `"albedo of bare ground [-]`" ``[double]`` Albedo of the land cover
      type, ranging from [0,1]
    * `"emissivity of bare ground [-]`" ``[double]`` Emissivity of the land
      cover type's bare ground, ranging from [0,1]
    * `"albedo of canopy [-]`" ``[double]`` Albedo of the land cover type's
      canopy, ranging from [0,1]
    * `"emissivity of canopy [-]`" ``[double]`` Emissivity of the land
      cover type's canopy, ranging from [0,1]

    * `"Beer's law extinction coefficient, shortwave [-]`"  ``[double]``
    * `"Beer's law extinction coefficient, longwave [-]`" ``[double]`` Beer's
      law provides the attenuation of light through a diffuse medium (in this
      case leaves) as a function of concentration/density (in this case LAI)
      and an extinction coefficient, sometimes called the absorptivity, which
      is usually a function of wavelength, but here is split into long and
      shortwave constants.

    * `"snow transition depth [m]`" ``[double]``  See below.
    * `"water transition depth [m]`" ``[double]`` Due to the need for smooth
      transitions (numerically) between various surface balance conditions,
      frequently a subgrid-scale model is used that, rather than trying to
      smooth each model, varies an area fraction between 1 and 0 for multiple
      components (e.g. snow-covered, water-covered, bare-ground) of the surface
      cell.  These area fractions are determined by a model, but most
      frequently are a linear variation from 1 (e.g. fully covered by water) at
      this ponded depth and above, and 0 (e.g. no area covered by water) at 0
      ponded depth.  Then, multiple surface energy balances (SEBs) are
      calculated, one assuming the ponded depth is this thick, and the various
      components of the SEB are averaged by that area fraction.

    * `"dessicated zone thickness [m]`" ``[double]`` The thickness of soil
      across which water vapor must diffuse to reach the free atmosphere.
      Effectively, the bigger this value, the faster that bare-soil evaporation
      shuts off as a function of pressure/liquid saturation.

    * `"Clapp and Hornberger b [-]`" ``[double]`` This is unfortunate, and
      should go away at some point.  Clapp & Hornberger is a soil retention
      curve, and this WRM is hard-coded into a few CLM models that we use here.
      It would be much better to refactor this out, as we almost never use C&H
      and instead use van Genuchten WRMs, and those parameters are soil
      properties, not land cover properties.  Until those models are re-derived
      and/or refactored, we must provide this value.  When in doubt, just use
      1.

    * `"roughness length of bare ground [m]`" ``[double]`` Roughness length of
      the bare soil, used in calculating sensible/latent heat in the
      physics-based SEB model.  A typical value is 0.04.
    * `"roughness length of snow [m]`" ``[double]`` Roughness
      length of the snow-covered soil, used in calculating sensible/latent heat
      in the physics-based SEB model.  A typical value is 0.004.

    * `"Manning's n [?]`" ``[double]`` Manning's n [??]  THIS IS NOT CURRENTLY USED.
