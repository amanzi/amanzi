//! Distributes and downregulates potential transpiration to the rooting zone.

/*!

The transpiration distribution evaluator looks to take a potential
evapotranspiration and distribute it across the vertical column based on water
availability and rooting depths.  It also potentially limits the transpiration
to avoid taking water where it is not available (thereby crashing the code).

This model is based off of versions from both CLM 4.5 and PRMS.  It requires:

1. A root distribution profile.
2. A plant wilting factor (e.g. how water stressed is the plant?)
3. A potential transpiration, typically calculated from data or a potential
   difference based on a latent heat calculation.

Note this also requires columnar meshes -- meaning that the subsurface mesh
must have `"build columns from set`" provided.

A normalized fraction of water is calculated through multiplying the water
factor by the root distribution factor, integrating across the column, and
dividing by the integral.  This gives a factor which sums to 1 and can be used
to distribute the potential ET throughout the soil column.

Then, this potential ET is down-regulated and multiplied by the plant wilting
factor.  If there is no water locally, it cannot be taken.  Note that almost
always, if there is no water, this did not contribute (much) to the integral
and so is already small.  But if the entire root zone is dried out, this might
have been a bunch of small numbers which then got normalized to 1, meaning they
are all now significant.

Finally, transpiration may be turned off for winter -- relative to time zero,
parameters `"leaf on time`" and `"leaf off time`" are used to control when ET
is zero.  By default these are set to 0 and 366 days, ensuring that
transpiration is never turned off and the potential ET must include this
factor.  This is the right choice for, e.g. ELM output, or eddy covariance flux
tower data (where leaf on and off are already included in the potential
calculation).  It is the wrong choice for, e.g. Priestly-Taylor or
Penmann-Montief models, which are happy to predict transpiration all winter
long.  Good choices for those models depend upon the local climate, but may be
something like Julian day 101 for leaf on and Julian day 254 for leaf off (PRMS
defaults for US temperate forests).

Note that `"leaf on time`" and `"leaf off time`" are relative to the
simulation's zero time, not the start time.  Typically these are Julian day of
the year, but this assumes that the 0 time of the simulation (not the "start
time", but time 0!) is Jan 1.  This leaf on/off cycle is modulo the `"year
duration`" (typically 1 noleap).  Note if `"leaf off time`" < `"leaf on
time`" is ok too -- this is the case if simulation time zero is mid-summer.

WARNING: there is some odd code here in which some quantities are PFT based and
some are not.  It isn't clear that those are correct for all usages.  And there
is currently no accumulation on the result of this evaluator (which is
PFT-based) to collapse it into a single sink for use in the water balance.
DON'T USE THIS WITH MULTIPLE PFTS without really understanding what you are
doing! (NOTE, error added for NPFTS > 1)  --etc
