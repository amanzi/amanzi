//! A factory for creating nonlinear solvers.

/*!

Nonlinear solvers are used within implicit time integration schemes to drive
the residual to zero and thereby solve for the primary variable at the new
time.

.. _solver-typed-spec:
.. admonition:: solver-typed-spec

    * `"solver type`" ``[string]`` Type of the solver.  One of:

      - `"Newton`" See `Solver: Newton and Inexact Newton`_
      - `"JFNK`" See `Solver: Jacobian-Free Newton Krylov`_
      - `"line search`" See `Solver: Newton with Line Search`_
      - `"continuation`" See `Solver: Nonlinear Continuation`_
      - `"nka`" See `Solver: Nonlinear Krylov Acceleration`_
      - `"aa`" See `Solver: Anderson Acceleration`_
      - `"nka line search`" See `Solver: NKA with Line Search`"
      - `"nka_ls_ats`" See `Solver: NKA with Line Search, ATS`_
      - `"nka_bt_ats`" See `Solver: NKA with backtracking, ATS`_
      - `"nox`" See `Solver: NOX`_
    
    * `"_solver_type_ parameters`" ``[_solver_type_-spec]`` A sublist containing
      parameters specific to the type.

.. warning::

    `"JFNK`", `"line search`", and `"continuation`" methods have not been
    beaten on as much as other methods.  `"nka_ls_ats`" is somewhat deprecated
    and probably shouldn't be used.  Prefer `"nka`" for simple problems,
    `"nka_bt_ats`" for freeze-thaw problems or other problems with strong
    nonlinearities, and `"Newton`" when you have a good Jacobian.  While
    `"nox`" hasn't been used extensively, it may be quite useful.
