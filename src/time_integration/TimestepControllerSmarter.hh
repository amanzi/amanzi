//! Slightly smarter timestep controller based upon a history of previous timesteps.
/*!

This is based on `Timestep Controller Standard`_, but also tries to be a bit
smarter to avoid repeated increase/decrease loops where the step size
decreases, converges in few iterations, increases, but then fails again.  It
also tries to grow the step geometrically to more quickly recover from tricky
nonlinearities.

.. _timestep-controller-smarter-spec:
.. admonition:: timestep-controller-smarter-spec

    * `"max iterations`" ``[int]`` :math:`N^{max}`, decrease the timestep if the previous step took more than this.
    * `"min iterations`" ``[int]`` :math:`N^{min}`, increase the timestep if the previous step took less than this.
    * `"time step reduction factor`" ``[double]`` :math:`f_{reduction}`, reduce the previous timestep by this multiple.
    * `"time step increase factor`" ``[double]`` :math:`f_{increase}`, increase the previous timestep by this multiple.  Note that this can be modified geometrically in the case of repeated successful steps.
    * `"max time step increase factor`" ``[double]`` **10.** The max :math:`f_{increase}` will ever get.
    * `"growth wait after fail`" ``[int]`` Wait at least this many timesteps before attempting to grow the timestep after a failed timestep.
    * `"count before increasing increase factor`" ``[int]`` Require this many successive increasions before multiplying :math:`f_{increase}` by itself.
