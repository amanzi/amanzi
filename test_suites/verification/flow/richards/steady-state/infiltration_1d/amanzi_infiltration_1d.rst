Infiltration 1D
===============

Capabilities Tested
-------------------

 * partially saturated one-dimensional flow
 * steady-state flow
 * pressure and flux boundary conditions
 * porous medium with discontinuous properties (permeability, van Genuchten parameters)


Background
----------

Verification problems from the literature have been identified to test
isothermal, single-phase, variably saturated flow.  We initially focus
on test problems that address the two most widely used k-s-p
functions, Mualem-van Genuchten :cite:`scinfil-Mualem_1976` :cite:`scinfil-vanGenuchten_1980` and Brooks-Corey :cite:`scinfil-brooks1964hydraulic`.  These include
steady-state and transient tests with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary
conditions.

This documentation is intended to compare
the results from Amanzi against the semi-analytical results documented
in "A set of Analytical Benchmarks to Test Numerical Models of Flow
and Transport in Soils." by J. Vanderborght,
et. al. http://vzj.geoscienceworld.org/content/4/1/206.abstract :cite:`scinfil-vanderborght2005set`,
see the first line in Table 3 of that paper. 
We consider three cases of the steady-state flux in a layered soil profile. 
The presure profiles should match that in the Vanderborght paper.
The difference between the cases is as follows:

 * case #1 is 0.5 m of clay and 1.5 m of sand;
 * case #2 is 0.5 m of loam and 1.5 m of sand;
 * case #3 is 1.5 m of loam and 0.5 m of sand.



Model
-----

Initial condition.
Pressure :math:`p` as the function of depths z and time t=0 is 81747 Pa.

Boundary conditions. 
The pressure at z=0m, the left end in the Figures below, is 99630.6336 Pa.
The outflow at the opposite end, z=2m, is fixed at 0.5 cm/d = 5.78703704E-8 m/s.

The absolute permeability tensor is isotropic but discontinuous.
The porosity is constant in all tests, :math:`\phi=0.43`.

Problem Specification
---------------------

The problem is solved in a box domain with hight 2 m. The other box dimenstions are equal to 1 m.


Mesh
~~~~

We consider a column mesh with 200 cells in the vertical direction.


Case #1: Sand Clay Layers
-------------------------

The steady-state solution is shown below.
The sand region corresponds to the left part of the pressure profile.
The van Genuchten parameters are :math:`\alpha=1.532333\cdot 10^{-3}`, :math:`m=0.6666667`, and 
residual saturation is :math:`s_r=0.104651`.
The absolute permeability is given by the isotropic tensor :math:`K=1.18472\cdot 10^{-11} [m^2]`.

The clay region corresponds to the right part of the pressure profile.
The van Genuchten parameters are :math:`\alpha=1.02 \cdot 10^{-4}`, :math:`m=0.0909`, and 
residual saturation is :math:`s_r=0.25`.
The absolute permeability is given by the isotropic tensor :math:`K=1.18\cdot 10^{-13} [m^2]`.


Results and Comparison
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We compare with the Amanzi's golden data that were verified against the Vanderborght paper.
