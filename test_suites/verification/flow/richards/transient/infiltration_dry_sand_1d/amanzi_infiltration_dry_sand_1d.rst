Unsaturated Flow Simulations
============================

Transient, one-dimensional, unsaturated flow
--------------------------------------------

Vanderborght et al. (2005) present an analytic solution for a one-dimensional
wetting front traveling through an initially dry homogeneous sand. The test
problem is relevant to vadose zone applications with transient surface 
infiltration. Infiltration sources could include rainfall, runoff, ponding, 
surface disposal facilities (e.g., cribs), or pipe leaks. The homogeneous sand 
system is initially at low saturation under a uniform tension. A constant 
infiltration is then applied at the surface.  The wetting front moves 
downward as an intact traveling wave with the front position changing with time.

This transient one-dimensional unsaturated flow problem tests the *Amanzi* 
Richards equation process kernel. Features tested include homogeneous material 
properties, constant rate infiltration boundary condition, specified pressure 
boundary conditions, van Genuchten saturation function, and Mualem relative 
permeability function. Infiltration into a dry coarse-grained sediment such as sand
is numerically challenging because of the highly nonlinear behavior of the relative 
permeability function, which leads to a large pressure drop across a sharp wetting 
front. Computational efficiency is also being tested because small timesteps are 
typically required when the infiltration begins. 

The analytical solution is based on the one-dimensional Richards (1931) equation
given by

	.. math:: \frac{d\theta(\psi)}{dt} = \frac{d}{dz} \left[ K(\psi) \left( \frac{d\psi}{dz} + 1 \right) \right]
		:label: RichardsEquation

where the :math:`z` coordinate is *positive in the upward direction* [L], 
:math:`\psi` = pressure head (:math:`P / \rho g`) [L],
:math:`K` = hydraulic conductivity [L/T], and
:math:`\theta` = volumetric water content [-].
The van Genuchten (1980) - Mualem (1976) functional forms are chosen for the 
water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves:

	.. math:: \theta(\psi) = \theta_r + \frac{\theta_s - \theta_r}{[1+(\alpha|\psi|)^n]^{1-1/n}}
		:label: waterRetention

	.. math:: K(\psi) = K_s \frac{\lbrace1-(\alpha|\psi|)^{n-1}[1+(\alpha|\psi|)^n]^{(1-n)/n}\rbrace^2}{[1+(\alpha|\psi|)^n]^{\ell(1-1/n)}}
		:label: unsaturatedConductivity

The subscripts :math:`r` and :math:`s` denote residual and saturated conditions, 
respectively, and :math:`\alpha`, :math:`n`, and :math:`\ell` are empirical constants.
