Transient Drawdown due to Pumping Wells in a Bounded Domain
===========================================================

Capabilities Tested
-------------------

This two-dimensional flow problem --- with a constant pumping rate in a heterogeneous confined aquifer --- tests the Amanzi saturated flow process kernel. 
Capabilities tested include:
  
  * single-phase, two-dimensional flow
  * transient flow
  * saturated flow
  * constant-rate pumping wells 
  * constant-head (Dirichlet) boundary conditions 
  * specified volumetric flux (Neumann) boundary conditions
  * homogeneous porous medium
  * isotropic porous medium
  * uniform mesh

For details on this test, see :ref:`about_bounded_domain`.


Background
----------

As we see from the comparison of results from Amanzi and Butler's solutions :cite:`bd-Butler_Liu_linear_strip_1991` :cite:`bd-Butler_Liu_radially_asymmetric_1993`, it is inevitable that the numerical solutions from the Amanzi model will not match the results from these analytical solutions at later time, because these analytical solutions were derived for the unbounded domains while in numerical simulations the domain is always bounded. In this example, we will verify the Amanzi model using the solution for the bounded domain with uniform hydraulic properties.


Model
-----

Transient flow in saturated uniform porous media can be represented by

.. math:: \frac{\partial ^2 h}{\partial x^2} 
   + \frac{\partial ^2 h}{\partial y^2} 
   + \sum_{i=1}^{N_w} \frac{Q_i}{T} \delta(x-x_i)\delta(y-y_i) H(t-t_i)
   = \frac{S}{T} \frac{\partial h}{\partial t}
  :label: flow

where 
:math:`h` [L] is the head,
:math:`t` [T]is the time,
:math:`T` [L\ :sup:`2`\/T] is the transmissivity, 
:math:`S` [-] is the storage coefficient,
:math:`Q_i` [L\ :sup:`3`\/T] is the pumpage at a  well located at :math:`(x_i,y_i)` that starts pumping at :math:`t_i`,
:math:`N_w` is the number of pumping wells,
:math:`\delta(x)` is the Direc delta function, being 1 for :math:`x = 0` and 0 otherwise, and
:math:`H(x)` is the Heaviside function, being 1 for :math:`x \ge 0` and 0 otherwise.

Initially the head is a constant everywhere in the domain:

.. math:: h(x,y,0) = H_0.
  :label: ic_bounded_domain_2D

The boundary conditions are:

.. math::    h({\bf x}, t) =  0, \text{   for } {\bf x} \in \Gamma_D\\
.. math::    T \nabla h({\bf x,t}) \cdot {\bf n}({\bf x})  = q({\bf x}, t)  \text{  for } {\bf x} \in \Gamma_N\\
  :label: bc_bounded_domain_2D

where :math:`\Gamma_D` is the Dirichlet boundary and :math:`\Gamma_D` is the Neumann boundary.

The drawdown solution can be written as

.. math:: s(x,y,t) = -\frac{4}{DT} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \sum_{m=1}^{\infty}
   a_n \sin(\alpha_m x) \cos(\beta_n y) 
   \sum_{i =1}^{N_w} \frac{Q_i \sin(\alpha_n x_i) \cos(\beta_n y_i)} {\alpha_m^2 +\beta_n^2}
   H(t-t_i) \left [1 - e^{-\frac{T}{S}(\alpha_m^2 + \beta_n^2)(t-t_i)} \;\right ]
  :label: solution

where :math:`\alpha_m = m \pi/L_1, m=1,2,\cdots`, 
:math:`\beta_n = n \pi/L_2, n=0,2,\cdots`, 
:math:`L_1` and :math:`L_2` are the domain size in the x and y directions, respectively,
:math:`D = L_1L_2` is the area of the domain,
:math:`a_0 =1/2`, and :math:`a_n =1` for :math:`n \ge 1`.
