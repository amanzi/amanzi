Background
----------

An aquifer is homogeneous and anisotropic when the hydraulic conductivity is a function of
direction only. Because of this, the transmissivity of such an aquifer varies with direction.
The transmissivity in the major direction of anisotropy may be 2 - 10 times greater than 
in the minor direction of anisotripy. Estimates of groundwater flow may be in significant error
if the effect of such anisotropy is not accounted for. The in-place determination of the
hydraulic properties of anisotropic aquifers, then, is of great practical importance. 

Hantush and Thomas :cite:`han-Hantush_1966_method` developed an analytical solution for measuring
drawdown during constant discharge for a completely penetrating well in a
homogenous anisotropic, nonleaky confined aquifer of infinite extent. Their work follows 
Hantush's previously published work :cite:`han-Hantush_1966_wells`, extending it by describing
a method for obtaining the transmissivity in any direction and storativity of a homogeneous
anisotropic non-leaky aquifer by delineating the expected elliptical shape of an equal residual
drawdown curve. 


Model
-----

The soil permeabilty varies in the *x* and *y* directions; thus, anisotropic
condictions exist. Hantush and Thomas simplifies to the Theis solution :cite:`han-Theis1935relation`, which
assumes isotropic soil profile, when the permeabilty is equal in all
directions for all times. This solution will yield contour lines of
equal draw down by an elliptical shape. The problem is described by the following 
governing groundwater equation:

.. math::
    \frac{\partial }{\partial x} (T_x \frac{\partial h}{\partial x})+\frac{\partial }{\partial y} (T_y \frac{\partial h}{\partial y})
    = S \frac{\partial h}{\partial t} + Q \delta(x) \delta(y),

where :math:`T_i` is transmissivity in the direction :math:`i` [L\ :sup:`2`/T], :math:`h` is hydraulic head [L], :math:`S` is the storativity of the aquifer [-], and :math:`Q` is the volumetric pumping rate of the well [L\ :sup:`3`/T].

The initial condition is

.. math::  h(x,y,0)=h_0

where initial head :math:`h_0` is often prescribed as hydrostatic head [L]. 

Due to the directionally-varying hydraulic conductivity, two transmissivities are
defined as: 

.. math:: T_x = K_xb \; \; and \;\; T_y=K_yb,

where :math:`K_i` is the hydraulic conductivity in the direction :math:`i` [L/T] and :math:`b` is the aquifer thickness [L].

Hantush and Thomas :cite:`han-Hantush_1966_wells` found the following solution to the governing equation in terms of drawdown :math:`s` [L]:

.. math:: s=h_0-h(r,t)=\frac{Q}{4 \pi \sqrt{T_x T_y}} \int_\phi^\infty
	  \frac{e^{-\psi}}{\psi} d\psi = \frac{Q}{4 \pi \sqrt{T_x T_y}} \; W(\phi),

where

.. math:: \phi = \frac{(x^2T_t + y^2T_x)\;S}{4T_xT_yt}


Notice that when :math:`T_x=T_y` (isotropic conditions), :math:`\phi` is now equal 
to :math:`u` and the problem simplifies to the Theis solution :cite:`han-Theis1935relation`.  The variables in the equations above are defined in :ref:`Variables` with subtle
differences.  We have now defined transmissivity in two directions and
redefined the well function, :math:`W`, to apply to :math:`\phi` instead of
:math:`u`.  The integral is still solved as a negative exponential integral.
